# Getting started with unit testing

Example code for https://www.aligneddev.net/blog/2018/getting-started-with-unit-testing/ and SD Code Camp 2018

How do you start writing unit tests?

I hope to show an example at my presentation and people will walk out thinking "I can do that".

Master branch is the base starting point.

The prep branch is my practice and preparation for the talk.
